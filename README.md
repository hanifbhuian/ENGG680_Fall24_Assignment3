Summary of Assignment 3: 
In Lab Assignment 3, key concepts in machine learning were explored, focusing on gradient descent and logistic regression. Gradient Descent was introduced as an essential optimization algorithm for minimizing functions by iteratively moving towards the minimum error, which is crucial for training machine learning models. Logistic regression was examined as a fundamental classification algorithm, particularly effective for binary classification tasks. Through this assignment, understanding was gained in the implementation of these techniques, observing the impact of parameter tuning on model performance, and analyzing real-world applications.Â
